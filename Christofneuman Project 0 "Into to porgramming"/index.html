<p> The web is a bunch of The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request to a server.</em> The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496"> This video</a> does a good job of explaining.</p>

<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block.</b> Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
